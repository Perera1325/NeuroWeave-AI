NeuroWeave-AI



Neural Network From Scratch with Interactive Brain Visualization



Overview



NeuroWeave-AI is a neural network built completely from scratch using Python and NumPy, combined with a dynamic brain-inspired visualization system.



The project demonstrates core artificial intelligence concepts including forward propagation, backpropagation, gradient descent, and real-time prediction visualization.
